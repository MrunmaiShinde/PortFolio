<h3>GUNS AND GULAABS</h3>
<p>Raj & DK work their magic once again with an interesting plot around very capable actors. Raj Kumar Rao is in his comfort zone as Tipu, the underdog hero that he has played with perfection in previous iterations. But the real standout among the cast is Adarsh Gaurav who plays a character similar to Divyenndu as Munna Tripathi in Mirzapur (albeit toned down a notch). Gulshan Devaiah as Aaatmaram plays a character you feel he has already portrayed on screen earlier like Mard ko dard nahin Hota but keeps us captive with his 4 strike knife kills. Dulquer in his OTT debut does a good job as well. </p>
<h3>KHAKHEE</h3>
<p>Inspired by the true story of how Bihar’s most dangerous criminal was caught, Khakee: The Bihar Chapter follows the epic tussle between two men on opposite sides of the law — one a dreaded gang lord (Avinash Tiwary), and the other a fiercely upright Indian Police Service officer named Amit Lodha (Karan Tacker).</p>
<h3>MADE IN HEAVEN</h3>
<p>It is the story of two wedding planners in Delhi, where tradition jostles with modern aspirations against the backdrop of big fat Indian weddings revealing many secrets and lies.</p>
